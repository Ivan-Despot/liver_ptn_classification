Advances in machine learning have allowed medical professionals to predict patient outcomes and classify patients with significant accuracy. It is certain that anyone aspiring to pursure a career in the medical field should familiarize themselves with these tools. The goal of this project is the explore the use of feature and model selection on an interesting dataset. 

The dataset consists of 583 instances, 10 attributes and no missing values. There are 416 liver patient records and 167 non-liver patient records, which have been labeled by experts. For our purposes, we will approach this project from the supervised learning perspective. That is, we have our data *and* we have the **labels**.
